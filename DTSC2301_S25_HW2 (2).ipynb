        "In the file `https://webpages.charlotte.edu/mschuck1/classes/DTSC2301/Data/Ironman1819.csv', there is data on female finishers of the 2018 and 2019 Ironman Triathlon in Lake Placid, NY.  We will focus on the times to complete the three elements of the triathlon, swimming (Swim.Time), biking (Bike.Time) and running (Run.Time).  The units for each of these features is minutes.  The overall time (including transitions from on element to the next) is found in *Overall.Time*. Create a scatterplot for *Swim.Time* as a predictor for *Run.Time*.  As a note it is generally not a good idea in python to make feature/variables have a '.' in them.\n",
